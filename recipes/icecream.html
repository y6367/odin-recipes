    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it starts to steam, but avoid boiling. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk 4 large egg yolks with 3/4 cup of granulated sugar until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the steaming milk and cream mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks and sugar. Stir continuously to blend the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Transfer the combined mixture back to the saucepan and cook it over low heat. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This process forms a custard base.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract. Let the custard cool to room temperature, then cover it and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Once the custard is chilled, transfer it to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This process will aerate the mixture and transform it into smooth and creamy vanilla ice cream. Once it reaches the desired consistency, transfer the ice cream to a lidded container and freeze it for a few more hours to firm up. Now, your homemade vanilla ice cream is ready to be savored and enjoyed!</li>
