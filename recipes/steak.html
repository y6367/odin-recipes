    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak; Any Cut (We Reccomend Ribeye)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li>Generously season both sides of the steak with salt and black pepper. The seasoning will enhance the natural flavors of the meat.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Add a drizzle of oil, enough to coat the bottom of the pan, and wait until it starts to shimmer.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the seasoned steak in the hot pan. Cook it undisturbed for a few minutes on each side, depending on the thickness and desired doneness. For a medium-rare steak, aim for about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Once the steak is cooked to your liking, you can add a pat of butter to the pan and let it melt over the steak. Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the steak with the melted butter, adding extra flavor and richness.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a tender and juicy result. Enjoy your perfectly pan-seared steak with your favorite sides!</li>
